<p><a href="https://www.worldenvironmentday.global/">World Environment Day</a> takes place on June 5th. To bring up this subject, this application was proposed in the event "<a href="https://nextlevelweek.com/">Next Level Week</a>". <b>Ecoleta</b> is a complete application (backend, frontend and mobile). Its goals are to connect the people with companies which collect waste, and provide a simple way to the people find waste collection points.<p>
